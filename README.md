# Dther's Vis Fork

This branch of the repository contains my own personal hack of the vis editor.
It includes experimental changes which are stable enough for my personal usage,
but that I'm too proud to merge into master.

I keep it here for personal access and for the curious.

This fork is **NOT FOR PUBLIC USE**.
Expect messy hacks and undefined behaviour!
